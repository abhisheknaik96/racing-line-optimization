# racing-line-optimization

Goal: given a racing track, find the optimal racing line.

This project starts with numerous simplifications, such as 2d tracks, constant friction across the tracks, stationary vehicle-dynamics, and so much more. 

In its current form, it takes a representation of a 2d track as input and uses some algorithms to return the best racing line w.r.t. a given cost function. The hope is to develop good algorithms to quickly compute the optimal racing line given any cost function.

- This project uses the cool [procedural-tracks](https://github.com/juangallostra/procedural-tracks/) library for generating interesting tracks and visualizing them.
- _Why_ this project? [Because I love Formula 1](https://abhisheknaik96.github.io/#interests-and-hobbies) and some nights I dream of working with an F1 team!
